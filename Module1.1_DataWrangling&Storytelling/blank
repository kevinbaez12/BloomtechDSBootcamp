Welcome to the Data Science program at BloomTech! In this first sprint, we're going to dive right into data exploration and visualization. In this sprint, we'll practice these skills and learn to appreciate the many tools Python gives us for these tasks. This sprint covers many fundamental skills you will use throughout the program: loading data, data exploration, DataFrame manipulation, and visualizations.
